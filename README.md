This repository contains a MATLAB function that exhibits an integer overflow bug. The function `myFunction` is designed to perform conditional operations based on the input value. However, when the input exceeds a certain threshold, integer overflow leads to unexpected results. The solution demonstrates how to handle potential integer overflow using appropriate data types and error handling.
